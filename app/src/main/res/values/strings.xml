    <string name="scroll_text">In a vault deep inside Abbey Road Studios in London — protected
        by an unmarked, triple-locked, police-alarmed door — are something like 400 hours of
        unreleased Beatles recordings, starting from June 2, 1962 and ending with the very last
        tracks recorded for the <i>Let It Be</i> album. The best of the best were released by Apple
        Records in the form of the 3-volume Anthology series.
        For more information, see the Beatles Time Capsule at www.google.com.
        \n\n
        This volume starts with the first new Beatle song, “Free as a Bird” (based on a John Lennon
        demo, found only on the bootleg <i>The Lost Lennon Tapes Vol. 28</i>, and covers the very
        earliest historical recordings, outtakes from the first albums, and live recordings from
        early concerts and BBC Radio sessions.
        \n\n
        <b>Highlights include:</b>
        \n\n
        <b><i>Searchin</i></b> — A Jerry Leiber - Mike Stoller comedy song that was a hit for the Pigpen
        doing the Paul vocals. A live version is available on bootlegs featuring the Dead joined
        by the Beach Boys!
        \n\n
        <b><i>She Loves You – Till There Was You – Twist and Shout</i></b> — Live at the Princess
        Wales Theatre by Leicester Square in London, attended by the Queen. “Till There Was You”
        (by Meredith Wilson) is from the musical The Music Man and a hit for Peggy Lee in 1961.
        \n\n
        <b><i>One After 909</i></b> — A song recorded for the <i>Let It Be</i> album was
        actually worked on way back in the beginning, six years earlier. This take shows how
        they did it much more slowly, with an R&amp;B feel to it.
